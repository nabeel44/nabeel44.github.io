## Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio. As I learn new skills I test my understanding by creating personal projects. Here you will find some of my favorite projects.



### [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://nabeel44.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/)


I created this project to gain a fundamental understanding of how map applications like Google and Apple Maps work. I implemented the Dijkstra and A* weighted search algorithms. These algorithms use different heuristics to calculate which node they will next search until they come across the final destination. In the end, both algorithms guarantee the shortest path, similar to how map applications find the shortest route. To mimic real-world traffic accidents, stoplights, and other obstacles I created dynamic walls that force the algorithm to find a new way.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nabeel44/nabeel44.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
