## Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio. As I learn new skills I test my understanding by creating personal projects. Here you will find some of my favorite projects. *The local hosts for my projects have temporarily been taken down, I'm currently working on a long term solution*



### [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://nabeel44.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/)


I created this project to gain a fundamental understanding of how map applications like Google and Apple Maps work. I implemented the Dijkstra and A* weighted search algorithms. These algorithms use different heuristics to calculate which node they will next search until they come across the final destination. In the end, both algorithms guarantee the shortest path, similar to how map applications find the shortest route. To mimic real-world traffic accidents, stoplights, and other obstacles I created dynamic walls that force the algorithm to find a new way.

### [Marketverse](https://nabeel44.github.io/MarketVerse/)

This project was my first attempt at making a website. Marketverse will contain all relevent and recent information regarding both the stock market and crypto markets. This was also my first experience working with APIs. I implemented the Bing News Search API in order to find recent news on cryptocurrencies and various coin APIs to filter important statistcs to display. I then used these statistics to rank the top 100 cryptos. I'm working on creating graphs for each crypto that will display price information from the last 3 hours up to the last 5 years.
